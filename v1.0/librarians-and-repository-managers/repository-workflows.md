title: "Data management workflows"
excerpt: ""
---
Research data varies greatly between disciplines. There are also considerable differences in the communities addressed in each case and the institutions hosting data. 

Through comparing OAIS compliant workflows we are able to recognise that there are at least significant commonalities. The ODIN project analysed two workflows to obtain this conclusion, the data submission and management process of the UK Data Service and INSPIRE, the High-Energy Physics information hub.
