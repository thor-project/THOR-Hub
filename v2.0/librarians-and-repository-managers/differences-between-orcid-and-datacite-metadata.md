title: "What are the differences between ORCID and DataCite Metadata?"
excerpt: ""
---
One of the first tasks for DataCite in the European Commission-funded [THOR project](http://project-thor.eu/), which started in June 2015, was to contribute to a comparison of the ORCID and DataCite metadata standards. Together with ORCID, CERN, the British Library and Dryad we looked at how contributors, organizations and artefacts - and the relations between them - are described in the respective metadata schemata, and how they are implemented in two example data repositories, [Archaeology Data Service](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) and [Dryad Digital Repository](https://www.datadryad.org/). The focus of our work was on identifying major gaps. Our report was finished and made publicly available in September 2015. The key findings are on these topics:

* Common Approach to Personal Names
* Standardized Contributor Roles
* Standardized Relation Types
* Metadata for Organisations
* Persistent Identifiers for Projects
* Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata
